# 🎵 Music Event Landing Page | Figma to Webpage

I got this cool music event landing page design from [ui4free](https://ui4free.com/). Very unique and modern design made using Figma. And I developed this Figma design to a functional webpage using HTML, SCSS and Tailwind CSS. Functional Navbar, animated gradient buttons and much more. This landing page is mobile responsive as shown in the design.
